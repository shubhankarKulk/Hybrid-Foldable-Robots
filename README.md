# Hybrid-Foldable-Robots

As part of our minor project during the Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering at NMIMS University, Mumbai, our team developed and simulated an innovative adaptive quadruped robot with dual locomotion capabilities (wheeled and legged). This project aimed to enhance mobility and versatility by integrating both locomotion modes, allowing the robot to navigate diverse terrains effectively.
